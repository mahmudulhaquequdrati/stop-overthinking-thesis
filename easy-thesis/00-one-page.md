# The thesis in one page

<!-- CURRENT-STUDY:START -->

**Current study — 14 October 2026:** **464 unique test problems**.
Benchmarks: **164 HumanEval+**, **166 LiveCodeBench easy**, **134 LiveCodeBench medium**.
All six planned LoRA combinations are complete, one attempt per problem:

- **0.8B:** LoRA + OFF **14.0% (65/464)**; LoRA + limit 512 **14.4% (67/464)**.
- **2B:** LoRA + OFF **35.6% (165/464)**; LoRA + limit 1,024 **41.2% (191/464)**.
- **4B:** LoRA + OFF **64.7% (300/464)**; LoRA + limit 2,048 **71.6% (332/464)**.

LoRA alone means thinking ON without a thinking-token limit.
Older methods' all-attempt averages and first-attempt comparisons are labelled separately.
LoRA + OFF does not consistently improve on free OFF; the 2B/4B gains over free limits remain uncertain.

<!-- CURRENT-STUDY:END -->

We studied **464 unique code problems** using three small Qwen3.5 models.
The question: does training the model to think shorter beat free thinking controls?
A *LoRA* is a small trained add-on. A *token* is a small piece of text.

**0.8B: Thinking OFF 14.7%** · **2B: Limit 1,024 38.6%** · **4B: Limit 2,048 71.9%**

These are the best observed free controls with **464/464 coverage**.
“Free” means no additional training; generating answers still uses compute.

## What training added

| Model | Free control | Shared problems | Free accuracy | LoRA-1 accuracy | Gap (points) | 95% gap interval |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 0.8B | Thinking OFF | 464 | 14.7% | 12.3% | +2.4 | [-0.4, +5.2] |
| 2B | Limit 1,024 | 464 | 38.6% | 34.4% | +4.2 | [+0.8, +7.8] |
| 4B | Limit 2,048 | 464 | 71.9% | 56.8% | +15.1 | [+11.3, +19.0] |


In the earlier all-attempt analysis, all three free controls score higher than LoRA-1 alone on shared problems.
The 0.8B interval crosses zero, so its small lead is uncertain.
The 2B and 4B gaps have positive intervals. Both compare the same 464 problems.
These are retrospective, unadjusted comparisons, not proof of a universal winner.

## How to read the result

Each problem gets equal weight, whether it has one attempt or two.
For each problem, average its pass/fail results. Then average across problems.
2B and 4B LoRA-1 now cover 464/464 problems after the missing40 fill-in. Do not treat missing results as wrong answers.
Earlier LoRA-2 and loop checks cover only 234 problems.

The combined view was chosen after the runs. It was not a single preselected exam.
Collection details stay in the methods note; the main story uses all 464 problems.

Source: [combined results](../results/combined/README.md), calculated from saved graded answers. No model was run again.

## Completed LoRA combinations — all three sizes

LoRA alone means **thinking ON, with no thinking-token limit**.
LoRA + OFF and LoRA + limit use the same saved trained add-on.
No new training was done for these six combinations.

| Model | Combination | Passed | Coverage | Accuracy | 95% interval | Mean total tokens |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 0.8B | LoRA-1 + OFF | 65 | 464/464 | 14.0% | [11.0%, 17.0%] | 1,278 |
| 0.8B | LoRA-1 + limit 512 | 67 | 464/464 | 14.4% | [11.2%, 17.5%] | 4,979 |
| 2B | LoRA-1 + OFF | 165 | 464/464 | 35.6% | [31.2%, 39.7%] | 1,445 |
| 2B | LoRA-1 + limit 1,024 | 191 | 464/464 | 41.2% | [36.6%, 45.7%] | 4,072 |
| 4B | LoRA-1 + OFF | 300 | 464/464 | 64.7% | [59.9%, 69.0%] | 882 |
| 4B | LoRA-1 + limit 2,048 | 332 | 464/464 | 71.6% | [67.5%, 75.6%] | 3,511 |

### What the completed tests show

- **0.8B:** LoRA + OFF passes 65/464 (14.0%); LoRA + limit 512 passes 67/464 (14.4%).
  OFF without LoRA passes 68/464 (14.7%). There is no clear gain over OFF.
  LoRA + limit improves on the matching free limit by 3.9 points, interval +0.6 to +7.1.
- **2B:** LoRA + OFF passes 165/464 (35.6%); LoRA + limit 1,024 passes 191/464 (41.2%).
  The limit combination beats LoRA + OFF by 5.6 points, interval +1.1 to +9.9.
  Its 2.6-point gain over limit alone remains uncertain, interval −1.5 to +6.7.
- **4B:** LoRA + OFF passes 300/464 (64.7%); LoRA + limit 2,048 passes 332/464 (71.6%).
  Limit alone passes 330/464 (71.1%). The two-pass gain is inconclusive,
  interval −3.0 to +3.7 points. The combination uses about 11.4% fewer output tokens.

These are same-problem, first-attempt comparisons with historical references.
Intervals are unadjusted for multiple comparisons. They are not proof of universal wins.
Shorter output does not directly establish lower GPU time, energy, or money.
