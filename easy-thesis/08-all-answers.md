# Questions a teacher may ask

<!-- CURRENT-STUDY:START -->

**Current study — 14 October 2026:** **464 unique test problems**.
Benchmarks: **164 HumanEval+**, **166 LiveCodeBench easy**, **134 LiveCodeBench medium**.
All six planned LoRA combinations are complete, one attempt per problem:

- **0.8B:** LoRA + OFF **14.0% (65/464)**; LoRA + limit 512 **14.4% (67/464)**.
- **2B:** LoRA + OFF **35.6% (165/464)**; LoRA + limit 1,024 **41.2% (191/464)**.
- **4B:** LoRA + OFF **64.7% (300/464)**; LoRA + limit 2,048 **71.6% (332/464)**.

LoRA alone means thinking ON without a thinking-token limit.
Older methods' all-attempt averages and first-attempt comparisons are labelled separately.
LoRA + OFF does not consistently improve on free OFF; the 2B/4B gains over free limits remain uncertain.

## How many test problems?

**464 unique problems:** 164 HumanEval+ and 300 LiveCodeBench.
Training and the early pilot are excluded.

## What are the main scores?

**0.8B: Thinking OFF 14.7%** · **2B: Limit 1,024 38.6%** · **4B: Limit 2,048 71.9%**

Each headline uses all 464 problems. These are full-coverage free controls.

## Why not add all correct answers and divide by all attempts?

Some problems have two attempts and others have one.
That would give the former twice the weight.
We average within each problem first, then across problems.

## Why did older LoRA reports show 424/464?

Those reports preceded the extra 40 fill-in. Both 2B and 4B LoRA-1 now cover 464/464.
Missing results are not failures. We compare LoRA with controls on shared IDs only.
The 0.8B LoRA-1 covers all 464. LoRA-2 covers 234.

## Does the free limit beat LoRA alone?

The selected free controls have higher observed scores on shared problems.
The 0.8B gap is uncertain. The 2B and 4B intervals are positive.
See [the paired results](05-results.md) for numbers and limits.

## Were all problems selected before the experiment?

No. This is a retrospective combined view of saved runs.
The original study was selected earlier; later collections extended it.
We retain this history in the methods, without making separate headline stories.

## Do the old loop percentages apply to 464 problems?

No. They apply to the original 234-problem 2B analysis.
We did not rerun loop detection for the combined set.

## Did the completed experiments use GPU budget?

Yes. Notebook 24 records about 57.0 estimated compute units, not hours.
This document rebuild only reads saved scores and uses no GPU budget.

## Where can someone check the calculations?

[Per-problem values](../results/combined/per-problem.csv),
[source files and original counts](../results/combined/sources.csv), and
[the full audit](../results/combined/results.json).

## Completed LoRA controls

All six combinations are complete, with 464/464 results each.
0.8B: LoRA + OFF **14.0%**, LoRA + limit 512 **14.4%**.
2B: LoRA + OFF **35.6%**, LoRA + limit 1,024 **41.2%**.
4B: LoRA + OFF **64.7%**, LoRA + limit 2,048 **71.6%**.
These use one attempt per problem. Historical controls also have a labelled
first-attempt comparison; their all-attempt scores remain separate.
