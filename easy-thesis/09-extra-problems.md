# Collection history and coverage

The main easy-thesis view is now **464 unique problems**.
This page records where they came from; it is not a separate results story.

The original collection had 234 problems. Later collections added 40 and 190.
Their IDs are disjoint. The combined total contains 164 HumanEval+ and 300 LiveCodeBench problems.
The combined view was chosen on 13 October 2026, after results were available.
It should not be described as a single pre-registered test set.

0.8B used one attempt per problem. The main 2B and 4B runs used two attempts.
The 190-problem collection used one attempt. Some limit fill-ins also used one.
All available attempts contribute, but every problem has equal weight.

2B and 4B LoRA-1 each lack 40 results. Their coverage is 424/464.
Some limit settings and LoRA-2 also have incomplete coverage.
See [all method coverage](05-results.md) and [the source manifest](../results/combined/sources.csv).

Saved raw results and the formal thesis retain their historical numbers.
Those files document the original experiments. They are not the combined headline.

## Completed extension: 2B LoRA-1 + limit 1,024

**41.2% accuracy — 191/464 passed. Coverage: 464/464, one attempt per problem.**
This uses Qwen3.5-2B and the existing LoRA-1 trained add-on.

On the same 464 first attempts, limit alone scores 38.6% (179/464).
The combination gains 2.6 points and uses 6.4% fewer total output tokens.
The 95% gap interval is −1.5 to +6.7 points. A reliable gain is not established.
On the 424 shared first attempts, the combination scores 43.9%, versus LoRA-1 alone at 38.0%.
That gain is 5.9 points, with an interval of +1.4 to +10.4.

Earlier tables use all attempts per problem; LoRA-1 alone is 37.4% under that rule.
Do not confuse that number with the 38.0% first-attempt reference.
The extension is retrospective, with historical references and unadjusted intervals.
It does not prove training universally beats free controls.

2B and 4B LoRA-1 alone still each miss the same extra 40 problems.
Only these two gaps are planned next: 80 new answers, no training or completed-run repeats.
Other partial methods retain their stated coverage.
