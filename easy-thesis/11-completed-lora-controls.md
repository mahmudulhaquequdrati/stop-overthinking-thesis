# Completed LoRA controls: evidence and conclusion

We are at RESULTS → ANALYSIS → CONCLUSION.
The question is whether an existing trained add-on helps when thinking is off or limited.
For example, a student can use the same learned skill with or without written planning.
We change the thinking setting, then measure passing tests and answer length.
The main reference is the same setting without the trained add-on.
A gain over normal thinking alone is not enough to establish a benefit from training.

## All six planned combinations are finished

Notebook 21 supplied 2B LoRA + limit 1,024.
Notebook 24 supplied the other five configurations, with 2,320 new answers.
Each configuration has one answer and one grade for each of the same 464 IDs.
Notebook 23 is superseded by Notebook 24; do not run both.

| Model | Combination | Passed | Coverage | Accuracy | 95% interval | Mean total tokens |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 0.8B | LoRA-1 + OFF | 65 | 464/464 | 14.0% | [11.0%, 17.0%] | 1,278 |
| 0.8B | LoRA-1 + limit 512 | 67 | 464/464 | 14.4% | [11.2%, 17.5%] | 4,979 |
| 2B | LoRA-1 + OFF | 165 | 464/464 | 35.6% | [31.2%, 39.7%] | 1,445 |
| 2B | LoRA-1 + limit 1,024 | 191 | 464/464 | 41.2% | [36.6%, 45.7%] | 4,072 |
| 4B | LoRA-1 + OFF | 300 | 464/464 | 64.7% | [59.9%, 69.0%] | 882 |
| 4B | LoRA-1 + limit 2,048 | 332 | 464/464 | 71.6% | [67.5%, 75.6%] | 3,511 |

### What the completed tests show

- **0.8B:** LoRA + OFF passes 65/464 (14.0%); LoRA + limit 512 passes 67/464 (14.4%).
  OFF without LoRA passes 68/464 (14.7%). There is no clear gain over OFF.
  LoRA + limit improves on the matching free limit by 3.9 points, interval +0.6 to +7.1.
- **2B:** LoRA + OFF passes 165/464 (35.6%); LoRA + limit 1,024 passes 191/464 (41.2%).
  The limit combination beats LoRA + OFF by 5.6 points, interval +1.1 to +9.9.
  Its 2.6-point gain over limit alone remains uncertain, interval −1.5 to +6.7.
- **4B:** LoRA + OFF passes 300/464 (64.7%); LoRA + limit 2,048 passes 332/464 (71.6%).
  Limit alone passes 330/464 (71.1%). The two-pass gain is inconclusive,
  interval −3.0 to +3.7 points. The combination uses about 11.4% fewer output tokens.

These are same-problem, first-attempt comparisons with historical references.
Intervals are unadjusted for multiple comparisons. They are not proof of universal wins.
Shorter output does not directly establish lower GPU time, energy, or money.

## Settings and checks

The models are Qwen3.5-0.8B, Qwen3.5-2B, and Qwen3.5-4B.
Existing adapter weight hashes match the settings recorded alongside the raw outputs.
Sampling used seed 3407, temperature 0.6, top-p 0.95, and top-k 20.
The total output caps were 4,096 tokens for HumanEval+ and 8,192 for LiveCodeBench.
The limit is for thinking only. It does not cap the complete answer at 512/1,024/2,048.
Thinking OFF records zero thinking tokens.
Repeat stopping was enabled for 0.8B and 4B; 2B retained its original handling.
The saved environment records Python 3.13.15, PyTorch 2.9.1+cu128,
Transformers 5.18.0, PEFT 0.21.1, Flash Linear Attention 0.5.2,
and causal-conv1d 1.7.0. Model calculations used bfloat16 precision.
Notebook 24 requested batch size 128; generation could reduce batches if needed.
The full environment files and package list remain with each saved run.
The Notebook 24 ledger records an A100 80GB GPU and about 57.0 estimated units.
The earlier Notebook 21 ledger is separate; 57.0 is not the whole project's spend.
Actual billed units must be checked in Colab, not inferred as hours.

Checked: 464 unique IDs per configuration; no duplicate attempts; every answer graded;
no unexpected IDs; zero exact overlap with saved training IDs; grade/raw token agreement;
reference source hashes; generation settings; and recalculated problem-based intervals.
No new model generation, training, or generated-code execution was needed for this audit.
Grades were read from the saved benchmark runs, rather than re-executed in this update.

The new runs use historical references from earlier packages and batch layouts.
A matching seed does not guarantee identical random draws in different environments.
The combined analysis remains retrospective. It is not a new pre-registered evaluation.
We did not claim that the model never saw benchmark text during pretraining.

## Practical conclusion

OFF without training remains the simplest observed choice for 0.8B.
The 2B LoRA + limit combination has the highest observed full-set accuracy for 2B.
It has not established a reliable gain over the free 1,024-token limit.
The 4B combination nearly matches the free limit while generating fewer output tokens.
LoRA + OFF does not show a consistent accuracy benefit over OFF without training.
No new run is required to complete these six planned configurations.
