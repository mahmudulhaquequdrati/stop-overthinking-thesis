# How we did it

We combined saved graded results for **464 unique problems**.
No new answers were generated. No training was run.
This update spends no Colab units.

## What changes between methods

- Thinking OFF: answer without thinking notes.
- Thinking ON: allow notes until the overall output cap.
- Thinking limit: end the notes at a fixed token budget, then generate the answer.
- Think briefly: ask for shorter notes in the prompt.
- LoRA-1: use a small add-on trained on shortest correct answers.
- LoRA-2: use the original 2B study's larger training set; coverage is 234/464.

A token is a small piece of text. LoRA trains an add-on while keeping the base model fixed.
The reported limits refer to thinking tokens, not the whole answer.
The original output caps were 4,096 for HumanEval+ and 8,192 for LiveCodeBench.
The saved runs used temperature 0.6, top-p 0.95, and top-k 20.
Repeat stopping was used in the size extensions; 2B retained its original handling.
This is a summary of existing runs, not a newly standardized experiment.

## How accuracy is calculated

For each problem, count the share of its attempts that passed.
Then average those shares across covered problems.

```text
Problem A: 1 pass from 2 attempts → 0.5
Problem B: 1 pass from 1 attempt  → 1.0
Combined accuracy: (0.5 + 1.0) / 2 = 75%
```

Pooling the three attempts would give 66.7%. That would give A twice the weight.
Our combined score gives each problem equal weight.
We do not average rounded percentages from the old summaries.

Coverage means unique problems with results. A missing result is not counted as a failure. Only compare scores directly when they use the same problems.

## Tests and uncertainty

An answer passes when it passes every test actually used by the saved grader.
HumanEval+ used its extended tests. LiveCodeBench used up to 20 tests per problem.
Thus these results do not establish success on every available LiveCodeBench hidden test.
Generated code was checked in a separate process with time limits.
This update reads scores only; it does not execute generated code.

For a comparison, use the intersection of both methods' problem IDs.
Resample whole problems 2,000 times with seed 3407.
The reported 95% intervals are percentile bootstrap intervals.
Both methods remain paired on each sampled problem; attempts are not independent problems.
Intervals reflect variation across problems, not all training or generation randomness.
They are unadjusted for multiple comparisons and post-result method selection.

## A retrospective combined view

The 464 problems came from several runs with different attempt counts.
The original 234 were selected before their results; later collections added 40 and 190.
We chose to combine them on 13 October 2026, after seeing results.
This history matters for interpreting claims, but it does not prevent a labelled combined summary.
Raw files and the original formal thesis remain unchanged.

## Completed extension: 2B LoRA-1 + limit 1,024

**41.2% accuracy — 191/464 passed. Coverage: 464/464, one attempt per problem.**
This uses Qwen3.5-2B and the existing LoRA-1 trained add-on.

The missing40 LoRA-alone runs are complete: 2B passed 1/40; 4B passed 12/40.
Their all-attempt, equal-problem-weight scores now cover all 464:
**2B LoRA-1 alone 34.4%; 4B LoRA-1 alone 56.8%.**

On the same 464 first attempts, the 2B comparison is:
**LoRA + limit 41.2% (191/464), LoRA alone 34.9% (162/464), OFF 32.5% (151/464).**
The combination gains 6.2 points over LoRA alone, interval +2.4 to +10.1.
It gains 8.6 points over OFF, interval +4.5 to +12.9.
LoRA alone's 2.4-point lead over OFF is inconclusive: interval −1.7 to +6.7.
The combination uses 13.4% fewer output tokens than LoRA alone.
OFF uses 66.5% fewer output tokens than the combination.

Limit alone remains 38.6% (179/464). The combination gains 2.6 points,
interval −1.5 to +6.7. A reliable gain over the free limit is not established.

Earlier tables use all attempts per problem; 2B LoRA alone is 34.4% under that rule.
The 34.9% reference above uses first attempts, matching the combination's one attempt.
Archived 424-problem reports retain their original numbers as history.
The extension is retrospective, with historical references and unadjusted intervals.
No result proves a universal winner. Other incomplete methods retain their coverage.
