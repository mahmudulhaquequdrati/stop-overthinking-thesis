# How we did it

We combined saved graded results for **464 unique problems**.
No new answers were generated. No training was run.
This update spends no Colab units.

## What changes between methods

- Thinking OFF: answer without thinking notes.
- Thinking ON: allow notes until the overall output cap.
- Thinking limit: end the notes at a fixed token budget, then generate the answer.
- Think briefly: ask for shorter notes in the prompt.
- LoRA-1: use a small add-on trained on shortest correct answers.
- LoRA-2: use the original 2B study's larger training set; coverage is 234/464.

A token is a small piece of text. LoRA trains an add-on while keeping the base model fixed.
The reported limits refer to thinking tokens, not the whole answer.
The original output caps were 4,096 for HumanEval+ and 8,192 for LiveCodeBench.
The saved runs used temperature 0.6, top-p 0.95, and top-k 20.
Repeat stopping was used in the size extensions; 2B retained its original handling.
This is a summary of existing runs, not a newly standardized experiment.

## How accuracy is calculated

For each problem, count the share of its attempts that passed.
Then average those shares across covered problems.

```text
Problem A: 1 pass from 2 attempts → 0.5
Problem B: 1 pass from 1 attempt  → 1.0
Combined accuracy: (0.5 + 1.0) / 2 = 75%
```

Pooling the three attempts would give 66.7%. That would give A twice the weight.
Our combined score gives each problem equal weight.
We do not average rounded percentages from the old summaries.

Coverage means unique problems with results. A missing result is not counted as a failure. Only compare scores directly when they use the same problems.

## Tests and uncertainty

An answer passes when it passes every test actually used by the saved grader.
HumanEval+ used its extended tests. LiveCodeBench used up to 20 tests per problem.
Thus these results do not establish success on every available LiveCodeBench hidden test.
Generated code was checked in a separate process with time limits.
This update reads scores only; it does not execute generated code.

For a comparison, use the intersection of both methods' problem IDs.
Resample whole problems 2,000 times with seed 3407.
The reported 95% intervals are percentile bootstrap intervals.
Both methods remain paired on each sampled problem; attempts are not independent problems.
Intervals reflect variation across problems, not all training or generation randomness.
They are unadjusted for multiple comparisons and post-result method selection.

## A retrospective combined view

The 464 problems came from several runs with different attempt counts.
The original 234 were selected before their results; later collections added 40 and 190.
We chose to combine them on 13 October 2026, after seeing results.
This history matters for interpreting claims, but it does not prevent a labelled combined summary.
Raw files and the original formal thesis remain unchanged.
