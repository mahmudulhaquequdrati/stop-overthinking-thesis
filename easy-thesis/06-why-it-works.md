# What the results suggest

A thinking limit can interrupt repeated notes and leave room for code.
Thinking OFF avoids those notes altogether.
This is a plausible explanation for the combined results, not proof of one cause.

Imagine a student copying the same plan until the exam ends.
Stopping the notes can leave time to write an answer.
But it cannot supply a missing solution.

## Earlier loop analysis: 234 problems only

The original 2B run had 468 attempts per method.
Normal thinking hit the output cap on 190 attempts (40.6%).
Of those capped attempts, 69.5% met the study's loop rule.
LoRA-2 hit the cap on 192 attempts (41.0%).
Of those, 88.5% met the loop rule.
These are historical measurements, not estimates for all 464 problems.

![Original 234-problem loop analysis](../results/full-results/figures/fig3-cutoffs-and-loops.svg)

On HumanEval+, completed normal-thinking answers had a median of 672 thinking tokens.
This suggests unfinished repetitions contributed strongly to long output.
Training on finished correct answers did not explicitly teach recovery from loops.
That may explain its limited transfer, but does not prove such training can never help.

## Earlier LoRA-2 result: 234 problems only

The thinking-length ratio versus normal thinking was x1.00 [0.94, 1.06].
The original study did not find the hoped-for shortening.
This result must not be extended to all models or all 464 problems.
The original training and loop evidence remains in the formal thesis.

## What the combined analysis adds

The full-coverage 2B and 4B limits score higher than normal thinking and use fewer total tokens.
Thinking OFF is the cheapest of the main full-coverage controls on each size.
For exact numbers and paired intervals, see [the combined results](05-results.md).

LoRA-1 and LoRA-2 differ in training data and coverage.
A result for one is not a result for the other.
The best observed full-coverage controls also differ by model size.
Incomplete limit sweeps do not establish a globally optimal budget.

## Other historical checks

One “think briefly” wording conflicted with the code-only instruction in saved examples.
That does not show that every short-thinking prompt fails.
A longer-output retry changed both the available token room and the evaluated conditions.
Keep its original scope in [the formal analysis](../thesis/06-analysis.md).
Neither check is a newly calculated 464-problem result.

## Latest completed extension

2B LoRA-1 + limit 1,024: **41.2% (191/464)**, one attempt per problem.
The +2.6-point gain over limit alone remains inconclusive.
